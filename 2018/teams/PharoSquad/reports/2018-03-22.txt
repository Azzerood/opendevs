This week, we had 1 first concern that was deciding the version of Pharo we would use.

1) First, we tried to install PharoJS on PHARO 7 but it didn't work, we had theerror on Linux and Windows.

2) We decided to go back to Pharo 6

3) We continued running the test packages and created 4 issues about them

  *Issue #1: the first issue we made was about the interpreter, because we were trying to run tests and many of the errors we got were coming from the interpreter.

  *Issue #2 : The second one was about pharoJS not installing on Pharo7

  *Issue #3: The third one reports a bridge problem, that causes tests to crash and the browser to use too much memory.

  *Issue #4: The last issue states that one test package opens too many tabs in the browser and may crashes the computer.
