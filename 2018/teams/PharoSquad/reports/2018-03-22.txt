This week, we had 1 first concern that was deciding the version of Pharo we would use.

1) First, we tried to install PharoJS on PHARO 7 but it didn't work, we had theerror on Linux and Windows.

2) We decided to go back to Pharo 6

3) We continued running the test packages and created 4 issues about them

  *Issue #1: the first issue we made was about the interpreter, because we were trying to run tests and many of the errors we got were coming from the interpreter.

  *Issue #2 : The second one was about pharoJS not installing on Pharo7

  *Issue #3: The third one reports a bridge problem, that causes tests to crash and the browser to use too much memory.

  *Issue #4: The last issue states that one test package opens too many tabs in the browser and may crashes the computer.

4) We made some improvements to the Pharo page aswell (mainly to improve the navigation, and add newest documents)

5) We also added a bug on the Pharo BugTracker. We used to encounter infinite loop while trying to discover the Debugger. So we thought we might add an issue about it.
